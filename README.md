## Histogram ##

In this project taken from Codecademy, I have written a program that takes a user’s input, then builds a hash from that input.

Each key in the hash will be a word from the user, and each value will be the number of times that word occurs in the split string. So, the program will count up the number of occurrences of each word in your string.

For example, if our program gets the string "we will, we will, rock you” it will return a visual representation of data:

- we 2
- will 2
- rock 1
- you 1

This project was created to practice Arrays/Hashes in ruby.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby histogram.rb
```
